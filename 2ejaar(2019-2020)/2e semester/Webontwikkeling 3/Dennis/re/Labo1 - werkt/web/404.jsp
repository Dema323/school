yay 404!! nobody found anything, life is gone. this page is an illusion
If they found this page doesnt it mean that they found something therefore its not a 404 error?
Maybe they were asking about the requested file, but what would even be the point of that?
Shouldn't people be happy about what they were given instead of asking for more?
